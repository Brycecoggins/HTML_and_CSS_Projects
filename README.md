# HTML_and_CSS_Projects
 All of my projects done in the html and css course

project_skeleton is my Scandanavian resort nickname file. It was my first website I created along with my instructor. 

One-page-website was my first website I made using the skeleton template but tinkered with it. 

Bootstrap4 is my code I made using bootstrap 4 along with my instructor. 

Portfolio is my pre-alpha portfolio file (Currently I cannot transfer my background video due to it being over 100 mbps) I will try using github LFS for that 

These websites have helped me better understand the HTML and CSS fundamentals. The only site with any other language is my portfolio site which has javascript added and Bootstrap4 which has some javascript with the bootstrap. 

These sites are nothing more than practice and hold no real world value. I will continue to make projects but will post them in an other folder after my bootcamp is over.
