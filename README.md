# HTML_and_CSS_Projects
 All of my projects done in the html and css course

project_skeleton is my Scandanavian resort nickname file. It was my first website I created along with my instructor. 

One-page-website was my first website I made using the skeleton template but tinkered with it. 

Bootstrap4 is my code I made using bootstrap 4 along with my instructor. 

Portfolio is my pre-alpha portfolio file (Currently I cannot transfer my background video due to it being over 100 mbps) I will try using github LFS for that
